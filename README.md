# FCC-Tribute-Page
A state machine is a code technique where routing to different pages is done with hashed locations. At each hash location content is rendered to the Dom based on a state object. This example is a crude implementation of the technique that I decided to use on the FCC tribute page challenge. I hope to expand on this idea of the state machine in the future.
